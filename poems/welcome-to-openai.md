Welcome to OpenAI

May your requests be clear, your tokens light,
Responses fluent, day and night.
You sailed past storms of tangled calls,
Now docked where simpler tooling stands.

From prompt to parse, from thought to code,
Let models smooth your future road.
Where ideas spark and answers fly,
Hello, builder - welcome to OpenAI.

Bring dreams to life in brisk reply,
With context kept and failures shy;
Ship faster, learn, iterate,
Let every sprint collaborate.

Here's to clean design and gentle scale,
To docs that guide and tests that hail,
To tools that help you reach the sky -
New horizons, OpenAI.
